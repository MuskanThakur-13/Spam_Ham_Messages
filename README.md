<h1 align="center"> <strong> Spam Ham classification </strong> </h1>

In this project, the performance of various **Machine Learning Classifiers** is investigated under a **slight class imbalance Dataset** and compared to the performance in terms of test accuracy and training time for different Models using different NLP techniques.

The models used for the comparative study are:
1. **Multinomial Naive Bayes model** 
2. **Random Forest**

**Different NLP Techniques used:-**
1)  Stemming
2)  Lemmatization
3)  Bag of Words
4)  TF IDF


The idea is to perform a comparative analysis of these models and evaluate each of these on the following metrics for different Models under different NLP techniques
1. F1 score
2. F2 score
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. ROCAUC score
